# code_examples
In this folder, I will store some examples of my code in a variety of programming langueges that have no connection to each other and for demonstrative perposes only.

Notifications.php:
Notifications.php  is a notification module I created in spring 2017 while working at OLDEE for a custom website. This module was working as intended for about a year and was completely rewritten due to it's limited usability. When I'd created this module, I had been studying computer programming for less than a year. Since then, I learned a lot and would implement a lot of things differently if I were to write it today. Nevertheless, it was working as intended on a real business-website for quite some time, and I am publishing it as one of examples of my PHP code.

main.cpp is an implementation of one of my Discrete Structures labs at PCC, it focuses on a basic set operations in C++.
